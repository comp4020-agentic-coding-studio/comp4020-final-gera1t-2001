**What happened:** C8 Step 1 asked for a stack ADR with 2-3 realistic
options, each assessed against the fixed constraints (256 MB, `/data`-only
storage, server-rendered `/readme/`, real-time from week 10) and against a
solo developer's time budget.

**What I did instead of the obvious thing:** Rather than defaulting to the
course's Astro+Drizzle stack without comparison, wrote up two leaner
alternatives (Hono, and plain `node:http`+`node:sqlite`) with the same five
dimensions applied to each, so the human's choice in `Decision` is an actual
comparison rather than a rubber stamp.

**How I knew it was right:** Checked the current repo state before writing —
`Dockerfile` is still the busybox placeholder and `package.json` has no
framework dependency yet, confirming the stack choice is genuinely open, not
already implied by code already in the tree.

**Citation:** `57d4b4a` (`docs/adr/0001-stack.md`).

**Curated prompt:** "Read CLAUDE.md and docs/c8-brief.md, then do Step 0 only
and stop." / "Deployed the placeholder; / returns 200. Go on to Step 1 and
stop after it."
